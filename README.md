# Intro-to-QF-Exercise

In the fall 2024 semester I took the course *Foundation of Quantitative Finance*, where I was introduced interest theory, portfolio theory such as the Markowitz's mean-variance portfolio optimization, CAPM, factor models, Black-Shcoles PDE, options pricing theory, etc, and I had completed some exercises using Mathematica. For the purpose of reviewing these materials and enhancing my Python coding skills, I am working on these exercises again with Python and I will be recording them on this repository.
